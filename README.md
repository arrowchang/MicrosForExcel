# MicrosForExcel
<br>.cls files ars VBA scripts, which were written during my work as an EE 3 years ago. When I first see the magic of Micro 
â€” the way it works to improve working efficiency, I was shocked. And attracted by its beauty. Then I learnt VBA myself. So the
code may not "professional", however it works sound and realy a big help.<br>
<br>Since these scripts are designed to solve the particular problem, a couple of words can not describe their functions clearly.
The corresponding .xlsm file are the Excel file which allowing run micros. So you can open them through MS Excel, press the button
and see the example. Also, you can refer to the introduction on sheet "desktop".<br>
<br>After all, I'll have some explanation for the files:<br>
<br>@ABCompare: Compare the difference between file A and B<br>
<br>@BlackListItemsCheck: Check the target file if has black file in a buck<br>
<br>@MergeEEbom: Merge A and B to a single file<br>
<br>@SideApartEEbom: divide the file in parts<br>
